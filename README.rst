About
=====
   
Goal
----

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach 
women and their friends 
who are looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek
environment. The goal of this program is to increase the number
of women programming, especially in Python which is
a very approachable language to get started with.

Pedagogy
--------

The approach for this workshop is to have groups learning together
with at least one guide or instructor who can lead where needed, 
and help out as requested while participants work through the 
tutorials. At present there are two streams for the one-day workshop
participants: Web App or Color Wall.  One is more of a focus on the 
basics of programming (Color Wall) and is well suited to students with
very little experience in programming.  The other is a bit more 
involved and will require network access as it includes putting a Django site
up on the web.

Future
---------

As these workshops begin to happen it is hoped that attendees will
come back as assistants in future workshops with the end goal
of having former participants become guides/instructors at 
future workshops.  There may be a disproportionate amount of
male teachers at initial workshops which is why we are encouraging participants
to come back and take the lead as soon as they feel ready.

TODO
----

- put up links for each technology on the friday page
- installation instructions for each OS & technology that will be used
- fill out & clean up the webapp and colorwall pages
